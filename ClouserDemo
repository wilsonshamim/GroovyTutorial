A closure is a short anonymous block of code. It just normally spans a few lines of code.

package com.org

class StringDemo {
	static void main(String[] ar) {
	def c = 	{ p1 ,p2 ->  println "aa ${p1} and ${p2}"}
	c.call("wilson","shamim")

	}
	
}


{ p1 ,p2 ->  println "aa ${p1} and ${p2}"} is a block of code which is also called clouser where p1 and p2 are parameters.


def c = 	{ p1 ,p2 ->  println p1 + p2 }
	c.call(1,2)
  
// 3

def c = 	{ p1 ,p2 ->  println p1 + p2 }
	c.call("wilson","shamim")
// wilsonshamim
